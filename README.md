# chatbot





# hiya! 


# this is a chatbot for the contact page of den's website. 


# it interacts with the user, mimicing a chatbot, asking them for their name, email, and what they'd like to do on the website. 


# the only bug is that it scrolls from the top of the page downwards each time the user "sends a message" / presses enter. 


# also I'm not permanently storing any of the user's details anywhere,so if you actually wanted to make a mail list etc, you would need to link this program a database or something?
